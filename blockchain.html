# What is it?

*Trusted distributed ledger*

Current model:

   ```
   +---+       +---+       +---+
   | A | <---> | B | <---> | C |
   +---+       +---+       +---+
   ```

Unit: money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes

---

# What is it? (II)

With blockchain:

   ```
   +---+       +---+
   | A | <---> | C |
   +---+       +---+
   (bc)        (bc)
   ```

Unit: money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes

# Background

 Bitcoin (digital asset and payment system)

  - decentralised
  - peer-to-peer
  - verified public distributed ledger

---

# Components

  - Units (bitcoin)
  - Blockchain (public ledger) [distributed database]
  - Ownership (private/public keys)
  - transactions (transfer of ownership)
  - proof of work (mining [solve difficult arithmetic problems, to create a cost of establishing consensus])
  - hashing of blocks (immutability)

---

# Smart Contracts - after the bitcoin

  - Units (bitcoin)
  - Blockchain (public ledger) [distributed database]
  - Ownership (private/public keys)
  - **transactions (transfer of ownership [and more])**
  - proof of work (mining [solve difficult arithmetic problems, to create a cost of establishing consensus])
  - hashing of blocks (immutability)

---

# Smart Contracts (II)

  * data (code of the contract)
  * permissions (ownership of contract/asset)
  * workflow (chain of contracts)
  * trust transfer ?????

---

# Examples

  * multichain (simple, a lot of people hack on it)
  * ethereum (smart contract, popular in banking)
  * Eris/Tendermint
  * hyperledger - started by IBM, donated to Linux Foundation
  * R3 Corda - over 50 banks + exchanges that a part of consirtium
    - Wrote their own version from the ground up, the contracts are only held by the parties transacting
  * BigChainDB [github](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb)

---

# Ethereum

*Bitcoin 2.0*

  - Built by the people who worked on bitcoin
  - Uses smart contracts
  - Platform currency: ether

---

# The Good Stuff

  - no central control
  - redundancy
  - immutable
  - secure
  - visable
  - pseudo-anonymous
  - open source
  - Two levels of trust:
    * participants id
    * transaction integrity

---

# Risks

  - The DAO
    * kickstarter in ethereum (my poor approximation)
    * Raised 150Mil (the most successful crowfunding ever)
    * 3.6 mil ether (~ $72 mil at the time of the hack) currently frozen

    More info on the DAO hack: [link](https://medium.com/@pullnews/understanding-the-dao-hack-for-journalists-2312dd43e993#.90e7y8j6w)

---

# Limitations

  - Size 
    * current size of bitcoin blockchain: ~ 88 GB (https://bitinfocharts.com/) [2016-06-29]
    * size of ethereum blockchain: 16 GB [2016-06-10]
  - Fixes
    * Side channel (another blockchain along side that gets "folded" into the main blockchain)
    * Sharding (distribute the blockchain between the participants)
